## Description

The repo provides a docker image with necessary ML base models and code for face recognition. I trained the ML model
using potrait images/faces of people from my family and then sorted out images containing anyone from family from your phone, camera, whatsapp groups etc, so that I delete the remaining images from phone/camera without losing family pictures.
